/*

I may put examples here, but this explains reflection very well:

Essentially it allows you to access any data of a class, or scan for methods and types in the class.
It is slow, and violates many principles of OOP and access control.
Use cases are rare, although one example is how JUnit is able to test methods with test annotation.

The api is pretty self explanatory.
