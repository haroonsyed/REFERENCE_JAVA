# REFERENCE_JAVA

## A compilation and future reference of concepts I am learning through winter 2020/21

###### List of things learned so far:
1. Java Sockets
   - Built and Instant Messager App where multiple clients connect to a server
   - I already have knowledge of port forwarding, setting up servers, DNS, SSL so actually bringing the app online would be simple.
2. Threads
   - Nothing deep, just how to declare them and start them. 
   - In the future I want to actually build an application with them and know how to properly use them (thread locks, scheduling, etc.)
3. Design Patterns
   - I am going through all the major patterns in the GOF. 
   - My aim is to be familiar with them by the end of this winter so that I can apply them in future large projects.
